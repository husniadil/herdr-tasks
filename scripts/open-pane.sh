# panes, so each popup has an [[actions]] entry that runs this with the pane's
# id — which is what makes a keybinding able to reach it at all.

# Opening a popup that is already open is not a failure. Herdr answers "popup
# already open", and to an operator leaning on a key that IS the state they
# asked for, so this reports success. A real toggle (open, then close on the
# second press) is a different decision and is not made here.
